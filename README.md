## Microsoft Property
Design of the interface, choice of colors and the appearance of the controls were inspired by projects made by Microsoft for Windows 11.  
The WPFUI.Demo app includes icons from Shell32 for Windows 11. These icons are the legal property of Microsoft and you may not use them in your own app without permission. They are used here as an example of creating tools for Microsoft systems.
