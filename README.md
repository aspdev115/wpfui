## Special thanks
Crafting apps for .NET without the creators of tools like ReSharper or XAML Styler would never be such a fantastic adventure.

## Microsoft Property
Design of the interface, choice of colors and the appearance of the controls were inspired by projects made by Microsoft for Windows 11.  
The WPFUI.Demo app includes icons from Shell32 for Windows 11. These icons are the legal property of Microsoft and you may not use them in your own app without permission. They are used here as an example of creating tools for Microsoft systems.

## Segoe Fluent Icons
According to the EULA of Segoe Fluent Icons we cannot ship a copy of it with this dll. Segoe Fluent Icons is installed by default on Windows 11, but if you want these icons in an application for Windows 10 and below, you must manually add the font to your application's resources.  
[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/style/segoe-fluent-icons-font](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/style/segoe-fluent-icons-font)  
[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/downloads/#fonts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/downloads/#fonts)

In the app dictionaries, you can add an alternate path to the font
```XML
<FontFamily x:Key="SegoeFluentIcons">pack://application:,,,/;component/Fonts/#Segoe Fluent Icons</FontFamily>
```
